# Portfolio App
⭐ Star us on GitHub — it motivates us a lot!

This is a simple portfolio app designed to showcase my projects and skills.

## Participation in the "100 Commits" Challenge
This repository is participating in the ["100commitów"](https://100commitow.pl/) challenge. The challenge involves making at least one commit daily to an open-source project for 100 consecutive days.

The goal of the challenge is to encourage consistent contributions to open-source projects and to foster a habit of regular coding and collaboration within the developer community.

### Why This Project is Part of the "100 Commits" Challenge
My motivation for participating in this challenge includes:
- I have wanted to prepare a portfolio page for some time.
- This challenge has a community and Discord server where I can link my portfolio, which will be beneficial for the web app's SEO.
- Some of my friends from the Order Of Devs are also participating with their projects.
- I aim to make progress on it every day, step by step.
