## Participation in the "100 Commits" Challenge
This repository is participating in the ["100commitów"](https://100commitow.pl/) challenge. The challenge involves making at least one commit daily to an open-source project for 100 consecutive days.

The goal of the challenge is to encourage consistent contributions to open-source projects and to foster a habit of regular coding and collaboration within the developer community.

### Why This Project is Part of the "100 Commits" Challenge
My motivation for participating in this challenge includes:
- I have wanted to prepare a portfolio page for some time.
- This challenge has a community and Discord server where I can link my portfolio, which will be beneficial for the web app's SEO.
- Some of my friends from the Order Of Devs are also participating with their projects.
- I aim to make progress on it every day, step by step.

### Summary of the "100 Commits" Challenge

When I started this project, I thought I could finish some MVP before the end of this challenge. However, I couldn't. I didn't have much time for it, so I spent only 5-15 minutes on this project every day.

Some statistics:
- Few dates:
  - Start project: `01-03-2024`
  - Start voting: `12-06-2024`
  - Used joker: `15-04-2024`
- My contribution diagram after this challenge:

- Quantity of commits/stars in this project (before starting the voting):
  - Commits: 211
  - Stars: 16
    ![100commits_stats_commits.png](assets/100commits_stats_commits.png)

- Quantity of pull requests:
  - PR's: 124
    ![100commits_stats_quantity_of_pr.png](assets/100commits_stats_quantity_of_pr.png)

- Commits in the biggest pull request:
  - For some time, I started updating the diary every day, but I worked on another branch separate from the main one. So, for this statistic, I want to show the quantity of commits in my longest PR.
  - In this project, I used "squash and merge", so the main branch has fewer commits than all the PRs.
    - Commits in PR: 88
      ![100commits_stats_longest_pr.png](assets/100commits_stats_longest_pr.png)
    - My priority was to conduct some UX research on my own, so the PR related to this is quite large.

This project is still ongoing at its own pace.
