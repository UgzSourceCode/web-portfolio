## Documentation
- Documentation should be in English.
- All features/components/scripts should have descriptions included in the documentation.
- Decisions should also be documented.
- Documentation should be located in the docs folder.

## Tests
- I want to have unit tests for hooks and important elements.
- Before refactoring, it will be covered by end-to-end tests.

## Linter

## Architecture and File Structure
- The architecture and file structure will be planned, and pros and cons will be documented for various possibilities.

## Translations
- I want to have my portfolio in 2 languages: Polish and English.

## UI Design
- I should find few designs prepare some questioner and to community.
- Mobile devices have fixed sizes or aspect ratios.

## Content
- Transition from core to general information.

  - Name
  - Nickname
  - Email
  - Social media
  - Skills
  - Projects
- What I can say about projects:

## Contact
