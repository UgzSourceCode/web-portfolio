## Research plan

## Found designs
### SinanTokmak Web Developer Portfolio Website Template
Author: [Johan Leon](https://linktr.ee/johannleon)

Link: [Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1308624569713896610)

#### Defects:
- Interactive elements (buttons) should have aquamarine color, as well as highlighted elements that are not clickable.
- Active menu items in the header and in the left menu should have an aquamarine color. In the left menu, when an item is inactive, the color should be white.
- All elements should have equal, rounded corners, except for the "about me" text, which resembles a button, and the "send me a message" element.
- Color consistency was broken when it came to displaying technologies (4 additional colors were introduced, expanding the palette from 6 to 10 items).
- The search bar on the black page burns my eyes with its whiteness.
- Margins are too large and can disrupt the consistency of the page's appearance.
- Sometimes there are `<h1>` and `<p>` tags next to some elements on the homepage, but the author quickly forgets about them in subsequent views.
- It is recommended to check the contact form on a mobile device for readability and usability.

### Conclusion from all designs
Better way is use some classic design for this portfolio, because I don't have plan update and change it often after finish.
