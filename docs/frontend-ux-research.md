## Research plan
1. **Defining Objectives**: Initially, it's crucial to clearly define the research objectives. Are you aiming to understand user behaviors, identify issues in the user interface, or test a new project? It's essential to determine what you aim to achieve. For this research, aiming is understand what is important for user and how should show it.
2. **Choosing the appropriate research methodology**: There are many different research methods, such as competitive analysis, user observations, interviews, usability testing, customer journey mapping, etc. For this research, competitive analysis has been chosen.
3. **Creating Research Scenarios**: Prepare a set of scenarios or questions that will assist you in conducting research. Ensure that they are tailored to the chosen research methodology and will help in obtaining answers to the posed questions. For this research, scenarios you should find in [research scenarios](#research-scenarios) part.
4. **Recruitment of Participants**: Select the appropriate target group for the research. Participant recruitment can be conducted through various channels, depending on the nature of the study and the target audience.
5. **Conducting Research**: Carry out the planned research using the selected methods. Remember to maintain neutrality and avoid influencing respondents' answers.
6. **Analysis of Collected Data**: After completing the research, proceed to analyze the collected data. Depending on the research method, this may involve reviewing notes, transcribing interviews, analyzing usability test results, etc.
7. **Inference and Drawing Conclusions**: Based on the collected data, draw conclusions and identify key areas for improvement or development. Try to rely on specific data rather than just intuition.
8. **Implementation**: Based on the findings from the research, take specific design-related actions to improve the user experience. This may involve changes to the user interface, enhancements to customer service processes, etc.
8. **Testing Solutions**: After implementation, conduct tests to verify their effectiveness and understandability to users.
9. **Iterative Cycle**: The UX research and design process should be iterative. After completing one iteration, analyze the results, draw conclusions, and move on to the next iteration to continuously improve the product.

## Research scenarios
1. Prepare few questions:
   - Does the design capture attention and encourage interaction? (What graphical elements are the most attractive?)
   - Are users able to easily find information? (How do you rate the readability of the content?; Is the navigation intuitive?)
   - Is the design responsive and functioning correctly on various devices? (What are the user experiences on different devices?; Are interactions smooth and seamless on smartphones, tablets, and computers?)
   - Are there areas that users find difficult or unintuitive?
   - Is the design compliant with the latest trends and industry standards? (Does it meet current UX/UI standards?; Does it incorporate innovative solutions in line with current trends?)
   - Are users easily situated within the project context? (What are users' first impressions upon entering the website or opening the portfolio?; Do they immediately understand what you do and what you offer?)
   - Are there any elements that deter users or cause confusion? (Are there any elements that may deter users?; Are there elements that are not consistent with the rest of the design?)
2. Ask few friend about designs
3. Ask people from social media
4. Find and ask 


## Found designs
### SinanTokmak Web Developer Portfolio Website Template
Author: [Johan Leon](https://linktr.ee/johannleon)

Link: [Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1308624569713896610)

#### Defects:
- Interactive elements (buttons) should have aquamarine color, as well as highlighted elements that are not clickable.
- Active menu items in the header and in the left menu should have an aquamarine color. In the left menu, when an item is inactive, the color should be white.
- All elements should have equal, rounded corners, except for the "about me" text, which resembles a button, and the "send me a message" element.
- Color consistency was broken when it came to displaying technologies (4 additional colors were introduced, expanding the palette from 6 to 10 items).
- The search bar on the black page burns my eyes with its whiteness.
- Margins are too large and can disrupt the consistency of the page's appearance.
- Sometimes there are `<h1>` and `<p>` tags next to some elements on the homepage, but the author quickly forgets about them in subsequent views.
- It is recommended to check the contact form on a mobile device for readability and usability.

### Conclusion from all designs
Better way is use some classic design for this portfolio, because I don't have plan update and change it often after finish.

## Questionnaire result
It's hard to find volunteers who can say what they think about design projects.

In first wave I found  only one person. His opinion was added to description of founded items.
