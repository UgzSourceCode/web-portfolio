# BiomeJS as linter and formatter
[< Back to PoC's list](README.md)

## Link to ADR
`placeholder for link`

## Branch name
`PoC-biomejs-linter`

## Problem description
The project needs a linter and formatter for better code quality. A few libraries are new, so they need to be compared.

## What is testing?
Testing is BiomeJs. Biome is a fast formatter for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and JSON.

Link to project: https://biomejs.dev/


## What metrics will be used to compare solutions?
- Formatting time: the time from start to finish of the formatting process.
- Lint fixing time: the time from start to finish of fixing linting issues.
- Lint checking time: the time from start to finish of the linting process.
- Integration with IDE: existing plugin/extension.

## Expectations
`BiomeJS` is tool based on Rust stack, so I expect that this tool will be faster than eslint.
