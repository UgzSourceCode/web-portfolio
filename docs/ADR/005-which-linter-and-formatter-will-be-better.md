# Which linter and formatter will be better?
[< Back to ADR's list](README.md)

## Context and  Problem Statement
For good code quality, it is necessary to have a linter and code formatter. The most popular ones are ESLint with Prettier, but these tools work quite slowly. If there is a faster alternative available, then I should use it.

## Considered Options
- Eslint + Prettier
- Biome.js
