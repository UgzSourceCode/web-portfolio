# [011] Which file structure is better for this project?
[< Back to ADR's list](README.md)

## Context and  Problem Statement
I know two ways (domain-oriented and technology-oriented) to build file structure in project. Both of them have some pros and cons, so I must decide which is better for this project.

## Considered Options
- Technology-oriented
- Domain-oriented

### Technology-oriented 
#### Example
```shell
/Project
├── backend/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── tests/
├── frontend/
│   ├── public/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── styles/
│   │   └── utils/
│   └── tests/
├── database/
│   ├── migrations/
│   └── seeds/
├── config/
│   ├── server.config.js
│   ├── database.config.js
│   └── frontend.config.js
├── scripts/
│   ├── deployment.sh
│   └── backup.sh
└── README.md
```

Pros:
- Easier understanding of technological aspects of the project
- Division of responsibilities based on skills - easier team management

Cons:
- Difficulty in understanding the business logic
- Changes in business requirements may require significant changes in the project structure, leading to complex project maintenance

### Domain-oriented
#### Example
```shell
/Project
├── authentication/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── validators/
│   └── tests/
├── user-management/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── validators/
│   └── tests/
├── payment/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── validators/
│   └── tests/
├── inventory/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── validators/
│   └── tests/
├── config/
│   ├── server.config.js
│   └── database.config.js
└── README.md
```

Pros:
- Organizing the project by business domains makes it easier to understand how individual parts of the project collaborate to support specific business functionalities
- Domain-oriented structure enables quicker response to changes in business requirements, as changes affecting specific domains can be more easily isolated and managed
- Easier refactor or change technology

Cons:
- Focusing on specific business domains may lead to greater technical complexity in the project, especially when different domains require different technologies or technological approaches
- Domain-oriented structure may pose challenges in clearly dividing responsibilities within the team based on technical skills, potentially requiring flexibility in task execution among team members

## Suggestion
This project need some options for easier refactor and faster adaptation to changes.

## Decision Outcome
For this project, a domain-oriented file structure was chosen.
